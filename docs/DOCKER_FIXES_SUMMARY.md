# Docker Compose Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Added Missing nginx Container
- **Issue**: nginx service was missing from docker-compose-dev.yml
- **Fix**: Added nginx service with proper configuration
- **Benefits**: 
  - Solves port 5000 conflict (nginx runs on port 80, proxies to API Gateway on 5000)
  - Better load balancing and reverse proxy capabilities
  - Health checks and proper timeout handling

### 2. Fixed Volume Mount Issues
- **Issue**: Agent-provisioning volume mounts were causing Docker sharing errors
- **Fix**: 
  - Created required directories: `apps/agent-provisioning/AFJ/agent-config` and `apps/agent-provisioning/AFJ/token`
  - Fixed volume mount paths to use relative paths
  - Added proper postgres_data volume

### 3. Fixed Container Name References
- **Issue**: agent-service was referencing incorrect container name `platform-agent-provisioning-1`
- **Fix**: Changed to correct container name `agent-provisioning`

### 4. Enhanced nginx Configuration
- **Issue**: Basic nginx config without proper error handling
- **Fix**: Added specific routes for health checks, API docs, and improved timeout settings

## New Service Architecture:

```
Internet → nginx (port 80) → API Gateway (port 5000) → Microservices
```

## Access Points:
- **Main Application**: http://localhost:80 (instead of http://localhost:5000)
- **Health Check**: http://localhost/health
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost/api/docs
- **Direct API Gateway**: http://localhost:5000 (still available for debugging)

## Next Steps:
1. Run: `docker compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up --build`
2. Access application via http://localhost (port 80)
3. Use nginx as the main entry point to avoid port conflicts
4. Test all microservices through the nginx proxy

## Benefits:
- ✅ Resolves port 5000 conflicts with macOS AirPlay
- ✅ Proper load balancing and reverse proxy
- ✅ Better error handling and timeouts
- ✅ Professional deployment architecture
- ✅ All volume mount issues resolved
