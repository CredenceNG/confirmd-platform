# Platform Admin Setup Session Summary

**Date:** July 12, 2025  
**Session Duration:** Extended technical troubleshooting and implementation session  
**Primary Objective:** Start platform admin container and achieve complete wallet creation functionality

## Session Overview

This session began with a simple request to start the platform admin container `f856e3a4-b09c-4356-82de-b105594eec43_Platform-admin` and evolved into a comprehensive implementation of local development infrastructure with complete wallet creation workflow validation.

## Major Achievements

### 1. Platform Admin Container Setup âœ…
- **Initial Request:** Start container `f856e3a4-b09c-4356-82de-b105594eec43_Platform-admin`
- **Resolution:** Successfully deployed platform admin agent using local credo-controller image
- **Configuration:**
  - Agent ID: `f856e3a4-b09c-4356-82de-b105594eec43_Platform-admin`
  - Ports: 8002 (admin), 9002 (tenant)
  - Image: `confirmd-credo-controller:local` (replaced remote ghcr.io image)
  - Status: Wallet opened, API token encrypted, multi-tenancy enabled

### 2. Local Development Environment Enhancement âœ…
- **Docker Compose Integration:** Added platform admin to `docker-compose-dev.yml`
- **Service Dependencies:** Configured proper startup order and health checks
- **Environment Variables:** Standardized configuration management
- **Network Configuration:** Ensured proper service communication

### 3. Database Infrastructure Resolution âœ…
- **Database Records:** Fixed org_agents table with proper platform admin configuration
- **API Key Encryption:** Successfully encrypted API keys using platform crypto service
- **Data Integrity:** Verified all database relationships and constraints
- **Organization Setup:** Confirmed proper organization and agent associations

### 4. S3 Storage Implementation âœ…
- **Problem Identified:** Wallet creation blocked by S3 configuration issues
- **Solution Implemented:** Local MinIO deployment as S3-compatible storage
- **MinIO Configuration:**
  - Service: `minio/minio:latest`
  - Port: 9000 (API), 9001 (Console)
  - Bucket: `confirmd-dev-bucket`
  - Credentials: `minioadmin:minioadmin`

### 5. AWS Service Integration âœ…
- **Modified File:** `libs/aws/src/aws.service.ts`
- **Key Changes:**
  ```typescript
  this.s3StoreObject = new S3({
    accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_S3_STOREOBJECT_ACCESS_KEY,
    secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_S3_STOREOBJECT_SECRET_KEY,
    region: process.env.AWS_S3_STOREOBJECT_REGION,
    endpoint: process.env.AWS_ENDPOINT_URL || undefined,
    s3ForcePathStyle: process.env.AWS_ENDPOINT_URL ? true : false,
    signatureVersion: 'v4'
  });
  ```
- **Purpose:** Enable MinIO compatibility with custom endpoint configuration

### 6. Wallet Creation Workflow Validation âœ…
- **Multiple Successful Tests:** Confirmed wallet creation operations with HTTP 201 responses
- **Storage Verification:** MinIO bucket contains 5 objects with timestamps matching API calls
- **Real-time Notifications:** Socket.IO connections established and working
- **End-to-End Validation:** Complete workflow from API request to storage confirmed

## Technical Implementation Details

### Modified Files and Configurations

#### 1. `docker-compose-dev.yml`
- Added MinIO service with proper configuration
- Enhanced utility service with direct environment variable injection
- Configured platform admin container with local image

#### 2. `libs/aws/src/aws.service.ts`
- Added MinIO endpoint support
- Implemented `s3ForcePathStyle` for path-style bucket access
- Maintained backward compatibility with AWS S3

#### 3. Database Updates
- Fixed org_agents records with proper API key encryption
- Verified platform_config and organisation table relationships
- Ensured multi-tenancy configuration integrity

### Environment Variables
```bash
# MinIO Configuration
AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=http://minio:9000
AWS_S3_STOREOBJECT_ACCESS_KEY=minioadmin
AWS_S3_STOREOBJECT_SECRET_KEY=minioadmin
AWS_S3_STOREOBJECT_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_S3_STOREOBJECT_BUCKET=confirmd-dev-bucket
```

### Service Architecture
- **Platform Admin Agent:** Core SSI agent for platform operations
- **MinIO Storage:** Local S3-compatible object storage
- **AWS Service:** Enhanced with custom endpoint support
- **Utility Service:** Wallet creation and URL shortening operations
- **Socket.IO:** Real-time notification system

## Validation Results

### API Gateway Logs
```
POST /orgs/.../agents/wallet 201 507.675 ms - 111
```

### MinIO Storage Operations
```
confirmd-dev-bucket/
â”œâ”€â”€ default/[timestamp-1] (wallet creation 1)
â”œâ”€â”€ default/[timestamp-2] (wallet creation 2)
â”œâ”€â”€ default/[timestamp-3] (wallet creation 3)
â”œâ”€â”€ default/[timestamp-4] (wallet creation 4)
â””â”€â”€ default/[timestamp-5] (wallet creation 5)
```

### Agent Service Status
- Clean operation logs with successful DID creation
- Proper seed generation and wallet initialization
- Multi-tenancy functionality working correctly

## Problem Resolution Timeline

1. **Initial Container Startup Issues**
   - Problem: Platform admin container failing to start
   - Solution: Switched to local credo-controller image

2. **Database Configuration Problems**
   - Problem: Missing/incorrect org_agents records
   - Solution: Fixed database records with proper API key encryption

3. **S3 Storage Blocking Wallet Creation**
   - Problem: AWS S3 configuration preventing wallet operations
   - Solution: Implemented local MinIO with AWS service modifications

4. **Real-time Notification Setup**
   - Problem: Socket.IO connections needed for frontend updates
   - Solution: Verified Socket.IO working correctly with successful connections

## Current System Status
