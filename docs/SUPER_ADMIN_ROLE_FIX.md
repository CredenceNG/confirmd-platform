# SUPER_ADMIN Role Issue Resolution

## Issue Description

The CREDEBL platform had a role consistency issue where:

- `OrgRoles.SUPER_ADMIN` was defined in the enum (`libs/org-roles/enums/index.ts`)
- Many controllers referenced `SUPER_ADMIN` in their `@Roles` decorators
- However, the `super_admin` role was **missing from the database**
- Only `platform_admin` role existed in the database

This caused 403 Forbidden errors for users because endpoints that required `SUPER_ADMIN` were inaccessible, even though the role was supposedly valid.

## Root Cause

The seed data file (`libs/prisma-service/prisma/data/credebl-master-table.json`) was missing the `super_admin` role definition, so it was never created during database initialization.

## Solution Applied

1. **Updated seed data**: Added `super_admin` role to the master table JSON file
2. **Manual database insertion**: Added the missing role directly to the database:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO org_roles (id, name, description, "createDateTime", "createdBy", "lastChangedDateTime", "lastChangedBy")
   VALUES (gen_random_uuid(), 'super_admin', 'Administrative privileges within organization', NOW(), 1, NOW(), 1);
   ```

## Role Hierarchy (Updated)

Based on the documentation in `docs/PLATFORM_FEATURES_AND_ONBOARDING.md`, the complete role hierarchy is:

1. **Platform Admin** (`platform_admin`) - Highest level access, platform-wide administration
2. **Organization Owner** (`owner`) - Full control over their organization
3. **Super Admin** (`super_admin`) - Administrative privileges within organization ✅ **FIXED**
4. **Admin** (`admin`) - Limited organization administration
5. **Issuer** (`issuer`) - Credential issuance capabilities
6. **Verifier** (`verifier`) - Credential verification capabilities
7. **Member** (`member`) - Basic organization member
8. **Holder** (`holder`) - Individual credential holder

## Database Verification

All roles now exist in the database:

```
      name      |                  description
----------------+-----------------------------------------------
 admin          | Organization Admin
 holder         | Receives credentials issued by organization
 issuer         | Organization Credential Issuer
 member         | Joins the organization as member
 owner          | Organization Owner
 platform_admin | To setup all the platform of the user
 super_admin    | Administrative privileges within organization  ← ADDED
 verifier       | Organization Credential Verifier
```

## Impact

- ✅ Controllers using `@Roles(OrgRoles.SUPER_ADMIN)` will now work correctly
- ✅ Users can be assigned the `super_admin` role
- ✅ Role-based access control is now consistent between enum and database
- ✅ No more 403 errors for valid `super_admin` role usage

## Files Modified

1. `/Users/itopa/projects/confirmd-platform/libs/prisma-service/prisma/data/credebl-master-table.json` - Added super_admin role
2. Database: `org_roles` table - Added super_admin record

## Next Steps

For future deployments, the seed data now includes the `super_admin` role, so this issue won't occur again. The platform now has proper role consistency between the application layer and database layer.
